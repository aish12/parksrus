### Self Critique
- What did we do well?
    - Communication, design, GitHub issues, communication between frontend and backend

    - Listening to feedback from others, prioritizing tasks, how to critique others and ourselves

+++
### Self Critique

- What can we do better?
    - Make images on instance page look better, refactoring model components
- What puzzles us?
    - How do we automatically filter API content?

---

### Other Critique
- What did they do well?
    - Beautiful design and theme, professionalism, structure of searching and sorting
- What did we learn from their API/Website?
    - We could use smaller images and fit more info onto a single web page. 

+++

### Other Critique
- What can they do better?
    - Could clean up data better (sometimes tags on snapshots aren't always actual real tags, EX: #uploaded:by=flickr_mobile) 
- What puzzles us about their API/Website?
    - Website is very intuitive; however, there are some problems with API connectivity (Coffee Shops vs /shops, multiple API requests when fetching data. 2 fail and 1 succeeds)
